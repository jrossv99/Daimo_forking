**Thanks for your interesting in improving Daimo.**

1. **We appreciate bug reports.** Please keep them concise. Include screenshots
   and debug logs, if applicable.

2. **Feature requests should be tightly scoped and well-motivated.** Daimo is
   a minimalist, focused application. "Perfection is achieved not when there's
   nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove."

3. **Discuss pull requests first.** Comment on an issue if you have a plan for
   how to implement a fix. We want to respect your time. We can't guarantee any
   PR will be merged. Avoid bundling multiple changes into one PR.

4. **If it's your first time contributing, we recommend starting with a bug fix.**
   See open issues.

Daimo prioritizes security, simplicity, ease of understanding, dependency
hygiene, and quality tests. We want to write as little code as possible, but we
don't want to engage in excess cleverness or code-golfing. Basic is good.
Comments summarize each class or function in plain English. Earning user trust
is paramount, and one of the foundations is setting a high bar for our codebase.

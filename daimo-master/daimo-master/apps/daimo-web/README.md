# Daimo web app

- The landing page
- App links. These open in-app, if installed. Otherwise, the page directs users to app store to install.
- In the future, potentially accounts and transactions
- In the limit, potentially a minimalist block explorer

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.
